### REFLECTION

1) What are the key differences between unary, server streaming, and bi-directional streaming RPC (Remote Procedure Call) methods, and in what scenarios would each be most suitable?

- Unary RPC involves a single request from the client and a single response from the server. It's best suited for simple tasks like retrieving a user profile or submitting a form.

- Server-streaming RPC allows the client to send one request while the server responds with a stream of messages over time—ideal for use cases like real-time data feeds or delivering paginated results.

- Bidirectional streaming RPC enables both the client and server to send messages independently over a shared connection, making it perfect for interactive, real-time systems such as chat applications or collaborative tools.

2) What are the potential security considerations involved in implementing a gRPC service in Rust, particularly regarding authentication, authorization, and data encryption?

Authentication can be managed through mutual TLS or token validation (e.g., JWTs) via interceptors. Authorization involves verifying user roles or permissions before executing RPC methods. All communication is encrypted using TLS 1.3, with sensitive fields optionally encrypted within the payload. Interceptors also handle logging, rate limiting, and security enforcement to prevent leaks of sensitive data. Certificates should be rotated regularly, private keys securely stored, and incoming data thoroughly validated for format and size to mitigate injection or overflow risks.

3) What are the potential challenges or issues that may arise when handling bidirectional streaming in Rust gRPC, especially in scenarios like chat applications?

Asynchronous message flow can cause one side to send data faster than the other, potentially overwhelming the system. Maintaining message order, managing connection lifecycles (e.g., disconnections or errors), and cleaning up inactive streams are all challenging. Without proper timeouts or limits, idle connections may consume resources indefinitely.

4) What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the tokio_stream::wrappers::ReceiverStream for streaming responses in Rust gRPC services?

This wrapper simplifies turning an MPSC (multi-producer, single-consumer) channel into a gRPC-compatible stream. It handles buffering and decouples message production from transmission. However, it requires careful buffer sizing, manual shutdown on stream cancellation, custom error propagation, and may result in extra wakeups compared to a more optimized, custom-built stream.

5) In what ways could the Rust gRPC code be structured to facilitate code reuse and modularity, promoting maintainability and extensibility over time?

Organize the code into logical modules: keep protobuf files separate, isolate transport and networking logic, and implement core business logic in its own layer. Use traits for shared behaviors to enable easier testing or swapping of implementations. Extract common functionality into utility functions or middleware. Group related features together to encourage clean collaboration and easier navigation across the codebase.

6) In the MyPaymentService implementation, what additional steps might be necessary to handle more complex payment processing logic?

Advanced payment handling involves validating inputs, connecting with external payment processors, maintaining transaction records in a database, managing authentication and authorization, implementing retries and error handling, detecting fraud, logging events, notifying users, encrypting sensitive data, and ensuring the system scales efficiently.

7) What impact does the adoption of gRPC as a communication protocol have on the overall architecture and design of distributed systems, particularly in terms of interoperability with other technologies and platforms?

gRPC enhances performance with compact, binary messaging over HTTP/2 and provides strong type safety via Protocol Buffers. It supports cross-language compatibility but enforces strict adherence to defined schemas. While highly efficient for internal microservices, integration with non-gRPC systems may require additional tools like REST or GraphQL gateways.

8) What are the advantages and disadvantages of using HTTP/2, the underlying protocol for gRPC, compared to HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/1.1 with WebSocket for REST APIs?

HTTP/2 offers multiplexing, header compression, and streaming, which significantly improve performance and efficiency over HTTP/1.1. However, its complexity may require more sophisticated infrastructure and tooling, especially for debugging and monitoring.

9) How does the request-response model of REST APIs contrast with the bidirectional streaming capabilities of gRPC in terms of real-time communication and responsiveness?

REST uses a stateless request-response pattern, where each interaction involves setting up a new HTTP connection, which adds latency. In contrast, gRPC’s bidirectional streaming maintains an open connection where both sides can push updates as needed, resulting in lower latency and better real-time responsiveness—ideal for live chats, dashboards, or collaborative environments.

10) What are the implications of the schema-based approach of gRPC, using Protocol Buffers, compared to the more flexible, schema-less nature of JSON in REST API payloads?

gRPC’s use of Protocol Buffers enforces strict schemas, enabling faster, smaller, and more consistent data exchanges. However, it’s less flexible and requires schema definitions up front. REST with JSON is more human-readable and flexible but can lead to inconsistencies and larger payloads. gRPC is better for performance and structured environments, while JSON is easier for quick development and integration.
